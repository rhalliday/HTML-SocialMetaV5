HTML::SocialMeta - Module to generate Social Media Meta Tags, 

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.5

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use HTML::SocialMeta;
    # summary or featured image card setup
    my $social = HTML::SocialMeta->new(
        site => '',
        site_name => '',
        title => '',
        description => '',
        image	=> '',
        fb_app_id => '',
	url  => '',  # optional
        ... => '',
        ... => '',
    );

    # returns meta tags for all providers	
    # additional options 'featured_image',  'app', 'player'   
    my $meta_tags = $social->create('summary');

    # returns meta tags specificly for a single provider
    my $twitter_tags = $social->twitter;
    my $opengraph_tags = $social->opengraph;

    my $twitter = $social->twitter;
    my $twitter->create('summary');
    
    # Alternatively call a card directly
    my $summary_card = $meta_tags->twitter->create_summary;
    
    ....
    # You then need to insert these meta tags in the head of your html, 
    # one way of implementing this if you are using Catalyst and Template Toolkit would be ..
    
    # controller 
    $c->stash->{meta_tags} = $meta_tags;
    
    # template
    [% meta_tags | html %]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module generates social meta tags.

i.e  $social->create('summary') will generate:
    
    <meta name="twitter:card" content="summary"/>
    <meta name="twitter:site" content="@example_twitter"/>
    <meta name="twitter:title" content="You can have any title you wish here"/>
    <meta name="twitter:description" content="Description goes here may have to do a little validation"/>
    <meta name="twitter:image" content="www.urltoimage.com/blah.jpg"/>
    <meta property="og:type" content="thumbnail"/>
    <meta property="og:title" content="You can have any title you wish here"/>
    <meta property="og:description" content="Description goes here may have to do a little validation"/>
    <meta property="og:url" content="www.someurl.com"/>
    <meta property="og:image" content="www.urltoimage.com/blah.jpg"/>
    <meta property="og:site_name" content="Example Site, anything"/>
    <meta property="fb:app_id" content="123433223543"/>'

It allows you to optimize sharing on several social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, Google+ 
and Pinerest by defining exactly how titles, descriptions, images and more appear in social streams.

It generates all the required META data for the following Providers:

    * Twitter
    * OpenGraph

This module currently allows you to generate the following meta cards:

    $social->create()  $twitter->create_       $opengraph->create_

=head1 DEPENDENCIES

Moose - Version 2.0604
Namespace::Autoclean - Verstion 0.15
List::MoreUtils - Version 0.413 

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

A. Twitter Validation Tool

https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards/validation/validator

Before your cards show on Twitter, you must first have your domain approved. Fortunately, 
it's a super-easy process. After you implement your cards, simply enter your sample URL into 
the validation tool. After checking your markup, select the "Submit for Approval" button.

B. Facebook Debugger

https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug

You do not need prior approval for your meta information to show on Facebook, 
but the debugging tool they offer gives you a wealth of information about all your 
tags and can also analyze your Twitter tags.

C. Google Structured Data Testing Tool

http://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/richsnippets

Webmasters traditionally use the structured data testing tool to test authorship markup and preview
how snippets will appear in search results, but you can also use see what other types of
meta data Google is able to extract from each page.
